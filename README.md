# Hypertuned Temporal Fusion Transformer for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting

This repository presents an application of the automatic hyperparameters tuning temporal fusion transformer (AutoTFT) model for time series forecasting of dam level in a hydroelectric power plant.

The considered data is based on measurements from the automatic hydraulic control of a hydraulic power plant during a flood. In 20 days and 1 h, the level of the dam increased from 20.46% to 86.27%. This situation raises the problem of emergency situations in power plants with dams, and how is necessary for the manager of the power plant to make decisions when it happens.
Given this task, the recorded data from a hydraulic power plant located in Pelotas River, Santa Catarina state, Brazil, is used to perform a time series forecasting to have the information in advance, and don't face emergency situations. The considered measurements were recorded in July 2020, considering a time interval of 1h, corresponding to 481 records.
