# Hypertuned Temporal Fusion Transformer for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting

This repository presents an application of the automatic hyperparameters tuning temporal fusion transformer [(AutoTFT) model](https://github.com/SFStefenon/AutoTFT/blob/main/TFT.ipynb) for time series forecasting of dam level in a hydroelectric power plant.
The methodology of this application is according to:

The considered data is based on measurements from the automatic hydraulic control of a hydraulic power plant during a flood. In 20 days and 1 h, the level of the dam increased from 20.46% to 86.27%. 
The recorded data is from a hydraulic power plant located in Pelotas River, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The measurements were recorded in July 2020, considering a time interval of 1h, corresponding to 481 records.
